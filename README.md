# HeroWarsAuto
This project is just to automate aspects of the game that I personally don't enjoy.  I used these tools because I wanted to learn them, not because they are the most optimal for this job.

To date, this will clear the tower and watch all of the ads assuming you are starting from the main screen.

Tools needed:
* BlueStacks 4 (https://www.bluestacks.com/)
* 64-bit Java (https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
* SikuliX (http://sikulix.com/quickstart/)
* Jython (https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1/wiki/How-to-make-Jython-ready-in-the-IDE)
* Hero Wars account (Mobile Game for Android)

Download the folder HeroWars.sikuli folder and open the HeroWars.py file from within Sikuli.
